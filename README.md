## About

This is a react app using html, css, and javascript in which an http request was sent to a barstool json fiile published online. I took all the important information from barstool.json file and delivered a nice web application that mirrors youtube.

## Getting started

Pull up your terminal after you have opened up the repo. You will run two commands.

## npm i

This will install all node modules so you can run the react app.

### `npm start`

This will run and start the app and will enable you to see the entire website.
